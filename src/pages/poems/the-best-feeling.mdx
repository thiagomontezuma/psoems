<pre>
    The best feeling on this life
    Is not when you receive an award,
    Excel in your projects,
    Or earn riches.
    <br />
    It's when you <span style="color:red">Love</span> and <span style="color:#2179dc">Help</span>
    Those who you might not even know
    But <span style="color:red">Need</span> you the <span style="color:#2179dc">Most</span>.
</pre>
