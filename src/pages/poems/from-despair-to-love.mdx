<pre>
    From the brink of despair
    Out of the sinking pit
    Touching the imminent death
    His hands <span style="color:red">reached me</span>
    <br />
    When the hope was gone
    Joy turned to ashes
    And everything perished
    His voice <span style="color:red">reached me</span>
    <br />
    When all I felt was hate
    He gave me <span style="color:red">love</span>
    When All I wanted was death
    He gave me <span style="color:red">life</span>
    <br />
    Incomprehensible and dull
    Who could ever?
    Who could ever???
    <span style="color:red">Love</span> while being hated
    <span style="color:red">Help</span> not being rewarded
    <span style="color:red">Care</span> being unthanked for
    <span style="color:red">Give</span> expecting nothing
    <span style="color:red">Zeal</span> for the needy
    <span style="color:red">Heal</span> the desperate
    <span style="color:red">Tend</span> the broken-hearted
    <span style="color:red">Save</span> the ones crying from within
    <br />
    Who could ever...
    <br />
    The only one who <span style="color:red">sacrificed</span> it all
    The only one who <span style="color:red">unconditionally loved me</span>
</pre>
