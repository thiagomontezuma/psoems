<pre>
    As the sun sets
    And its rays
    Shine through the Sky
    Oh my little lover
    Let's dance
    One last time
    <br />
    All we need to do
    Is dance
    Dance our cares away
    No Fear
    No restraint
    Just like two birds
    We could fly today
    <br />
    <span style="color:blue">Fly</span> as <span style="color:blue">high</span> as our love
    <span style="color:blue">Fly</span> like there is no <span style="color:blue">end</span>
    <span style="color:blue">Fly</span> as the <span style="color:blue">wind</span> flows
    <span style="color:blue">Fly</span> like I only see <span style="color:blue">you</span>
    &nbsp;   And you only see <span style="color:blue">me</span>
    <br />
    The skies will be our dance floor
    The sun will be our shining star
    And the stage is ready
    Just waiting for my beautiful one
    <br />
    Where you go
    I go
    When you move
    I move
    The sky will be small
    As we dance it all away
    <br />
    Oh my little lover
    Only a couple minutes left
    Let's enjoy one last moment
    Will you dance with me?
</pre>
